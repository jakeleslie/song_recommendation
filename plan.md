# Part 1:
Implement tf-idf based on genres since this will be the first best way to recommend music. 

# Part 2:
(since this will be practically impossible to do with limited storage)
have a few test songs that we can vectorize for more recommendation, for example for a proof of concept. 
Have the songs be selected and then have them vectorized and then compared with cosign similarity, and then with tf-idf. 
first do tf-idf to compare the genres, and if they are matching should run cosign similarity. 

# Part 3:
if time make a tui for it.
